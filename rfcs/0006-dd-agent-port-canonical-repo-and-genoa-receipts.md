# RFC 0006 — Datadog Agent BSD port: one canonical repo, Genoa-owned receipts

Status: Proposed (the owner decides; see "Owner decisions")  
Date: 2026-09-24

## Problem

The registry, the port repos and the receipt logs disagree about who owns what. The evidence below was collected on 2026-09-24 from the repos and ledgers themselves.

1. **The registry doesn't list the active port.** `docs/PROJECTS.md` lists only `dd-agent-FreeBSD`, marked `reference`. That repo is the old fork of the FreeBSD ports-Makefile lineage. The active port, `datadog-agent-freebsd`, has a `.project.toml` that says `status = "active"` and `canonical_for = ["datadog-agent-freebsd-patches", "datadog-agent-freebsd-releases"]`, but it has no registry row.
2. **Two repos hold the port's facts, which violates C1.**
   - GitHub `datadog-agent-freebsd` holds the patch series, the Nushell tooling, CI and 5 releases.
   - QNAS Gitea `studio/datadog-agent-FreeBSD` holds 22 releases. They include the builds actually deployed to the fleet (the 7.83.3 `r2`, `ipcfix` and `otel-agent` releases), and GitHub doesn't have them.
   - The QNAS repo also has a `master` branch unchanged since 2021, 32 open PRs with 0 merged, no Actions, and a build ledger (`builds/ledger.jsonl`) that lives on a side branch.
   - So the repo that claims `canonical_for` releases is not the one that holds what runs in production.
3. **Genoa doesn't own the receipts, despite the ownership rule** ("build/deploy/provenance receipts → Genoa"). Six formats are in use today:
   - per-host `DEPLOYED.jsonl` lines with no version. 13 lines use 9 distinct key shapes, 3 lines have no `result`, and the lines carry truncated hashes (`sha256_prefix`).
   - `ddfb.native-deploy/v1`
   - `ddfb.otel-deploy/v1`
   - the QNAS build ledger, `schema_version: "1"`, with 36 records. It also embeds deployment facts (`deployed_hosts`), which mixes build and deploy.
   - `ddfb.build-record/v1`, written by the port's `bin/record.nu` to its own JSONL
   - Genoa's image-only `receipt.v1`
4. **The port's `manifest.toml` hardcodes IP literals**, including the Gitea URL. Any schema that copies these URLs spreads that mistake.

## Proposal

### A. Registry (this PR)

- Add `datadog-agent-freebsd` to **Active system** as the owner of the patch series, native build recipes, gates and release definitions. Its row states that receipts are Genoa's.
- Keep `dd-agent-FreeBSD` as `reference`, and say that it is the old ports-Makefile lineage, not the active port.
- Add the lifecycle value `mirror` and a **Mirrors** table. QNAS Gitea `studio/datadog-agent-FreeBSD` becomes a mirror once the migration below is done.

### B. One canonical repo for the port

`datadog-agent-freebsd` (GitHub) becomes canonical for the patch series, recipes, gates, release definitions and `SHA256SUMS`. QNAS Gitea keeps a LAN release-asset cache, because the fleet installs over the LAN.

Why GitHub and not QNAS:

- **C3 (visibility is not durability):** the deployed lineage is currently a single LAN copy.
- **Tooling:** GitHub already has CI, the Nushell tooling and `AGENTS.md`. The QNAS `master` hasn't moved since 2021.
- **C2 and C11:** the release definition's sha256 is the artifact's content identity, so the mirror can be verified against it and rebuilt from GitHub at any time.

### C. Genoa owns receipts: `genoa.receipt.v1`

- **Genoa owns the schema.** It lives at `ryanmaclean/genoa:schemas/v1/receipt.schema.json` (Appendix A), with `genoa receipt append | verify | project` commands.
- **One append-only JSONL log per subject.** Git history of that log is the order (C5). Corrections are new receipts that set `operation.supersedes` (C21).
- **Port tools emit receipts.** The port's tools (`bin/record.nu` and the native/otel deploy scripts) emit `genoa.receipt.v1` and call `genoa receipt append`. They stop keeping their own ledgers.
- **Derived views only (C11).** `HISTORY.md`, Datadog notebooks and fleet snapshots are rebuilt from the log.

C20 statement:

- **Removed:** 5 of the formats above (all but Genoa's image receipt, whose shape the claims reuse) and their stores: the per-host `DEPLOYED.jsonl` files, the QNAS build ledger, the `bin/record.nu` ledger, and the two `ddfb.*-deploy/v1` formats. One format and one store replace them.
- **Invariant owned:** immutable evidence that an artifact was built, deployed, verified, rolled back or retired. The registry already gives this to Genoa.
- **Mutable state (C27):** none is added. The log is append-only.

### Schema rules (Appendix A)

| Concern | Rule | Constraint |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | `receipt_id`, plus `operation.operation_id` and `attempt`. Every retry of the same deploy shares `operation_id`. `run_id` links a BOP run; a Receipt is not a Run. | C2, C6, Glossary |
| Content | `artifact.sha256` must be the full 64 hex characters unless `trust.level = backfill`. | C2 |
| Order | Append order under git. `prev_receipt_sha256` is a hash chain for tamper evidence, not a counter. Wall-clock fields are metadata. | C5 |
| Completion | `outcome.completed = true` requires `gate.passed = true` and a stated `completed_invariant`. "Restarted" or "not failing" is not completion. | C3, C7 |
| Trust | `trust.level` is declared: `verified`, `self-attested`, `agent-report` or `backfill`. Backfill requires a `legacy` pointer (format, source, line, line sha256). | AX-first |
| Encoding | Receipt hash = sha256 of `"genoa.receipt.v1\n"` followed by the RFC 8785 (JCS) encoding of the receipt. | C24 |
| Hygiene | Hostnames and URLs must not be IP literals (enforced by pattern). `additionalProperties: false` everywhere except `metrics` and `tags`, so unknown fields such as credentials are rejected. | fleet rules |
| Claims | `evidence[].claim` reuses the claim/probe/expect/status shape that Genoa image receipts and fleet-eval already use. | reuse |

### Validation evidence (dry run, 2026-09-24)

A Nushell converter (a dry run that writes only to a local file) mapped all 49 legacy records into `genoa.receipt.v1`: 13 deploy lines and 36 build-ledger lines.

- **All 49 validate** against Appendix A (JSON Schema draft 2020-12).
- **5 bad inputs are rejected:**
  - an IP-literal host
  - `completed` without a gate
  - `verified` with a null sha256
  - an unknown extra field
  - an IP-literal URL
- **Findings:**
  - 32 of 49 records have no full artifact hash.
  - Only 14 of 49 meet the completion rule.
  - The converter found retried operations under a single `operation_id`: one config change was rolled back twice and passed on attempt 3.

The converter and the converted data stay off this public repo because they contain LAN hostnames and backup paths.

## Migration (after the owner accepts)

1. **genoa:** add `schemas/v1/receipt.schema.json` and the `genoa receipt` commands. Genoa owns this PR.
2. **datadog-agent-freebsd:**
   - In `.project.toml`, add `receipts_schema`, `mirrors`, and `receipt-store` under `do_not_implement`.
   - Make the tools emit v1 receipts.
   - Replace the IP literals in `manifest.toml` with the fleet hostname (`gitea.local`).
3. **GitHub releases:** add release definitions (tag and `SHA256SUMS`) for the deployed releases that exist only on QNAS. The assets depend on D2.
4. **Backfill:** convert the legacy logs once into `trust.level = backfill` receipts and append them to the Genoa log. Then freeze the legacy files, each with a pointer README.
5. **QNAS:** mark `studio/datadog-agent-FreeBSD` as a mirror. Push-mirror releases from GitHub. Handle the legacy `master` and PRs per D5; they are never merged.

## Owner decisions

| # | Decision | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Canonical repo for the port | GitHub `datadog-agent-freebsd`. QNAS becomes a mirror. |
| D2 | Where the bytes of the deployed binaries that exist only on QNAS go | Upload them to the GitHub releases, for deployed releases only. That gives two copies, one of them off the LAN. |
| D3 | Where the Genoa receipt log lives | A new **private** Genoa-owned repo (e.g. `genoa-receipts`). `genoa` is public, and receipts name LAN hosts and backup paths. Rejected alternatives: redacted receipts in public `genoa` (they lose evidence) and a `receipts/` directory in the port repo (a second owner, which violates C1). |
| D4 | Whether a private repo's name may appear in this public registry | Yes, the name only (no URLs or hosts). C1 needs the row. |
| D5 | The QNAS legacy `master` and its 32 open PRs | Freeze them as history: close the PRs with a pointer to GitHub, archive the branch, never merge. |
| D6 | The `mirror` lifecycle value | Accept it. `maintenance` would suggest the repo still owns something. |
